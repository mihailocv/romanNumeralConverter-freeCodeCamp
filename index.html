            <p>
                Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and were used throughout the Roman Empire in various aspects of daily life, including in commerce, architecture, and in the recording of dates. The system is based on combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.
            </p>
            <p>
                The smallest number that can be represented using Roman numerals is 1, denoted by the letter 'I'. The largest number that can be represented using the basic Roman numeral symbols is 3,999, which is written as 'MMMCMXCIX'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Roman numerals were gradually replaced by the more efficient Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and was introduced to Europe through the works of Middle Eastern mathematicians. The transition began in the Middle Ages and was largely complete by the 14th century.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite being largely obsolete in everyday use, Roman numerals are still employed in certain contexts today. They are often used to denote the year in the credits of movies and TV shows, to number the chapters of books, and to mark special events such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl.

              corresponding Arabic numbers. This can help you understand the
              conversion between the two numeral systems.
