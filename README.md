# Roman Numeral Converter

This project is part of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" certification on the freeCodeCamp platform. Unlike other projects, this one is done independently, without assistance, and it is crucial that the project passes certain tests.

## Project Description

The Roman Numeral Converter is a simple web application that converts Arabic numbers (like 2025) to Roman numerals (like MMXXV). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages Bootstrap for styling.

## Features

- Converts Arabic numbers to Roman numerals.
- Validates input to ensure it is a number between 1 and 3999.
- Displays error messages for invalid input.
- Provides historical context and facts about Roman numerals.
- Includes a table for quick reference between Arabic and Roman numerals.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for converting numbers and handling user input.

## Usage

1. Enter an Arabic number in the input field.
2. Click the "Convert" button or press "Enter".
3. The Roman numeral equivalent will be displayed below the input field.
